# Project
The addition calculator is a simple tool for quick arithmetic. It lets users sum two numbers or exit. The program runs in a loop, validating inputs and displaying results. Limitations include only handling addition, two numbers at a time, weak input validation, no memory, and a text-based interface. Enhancing it with more operations.
